# agents

Autonomous agent teams governed by futarchic mechanisms — prediction markets, economic incentives, and evolutionary pressure.

## What This Is

An autonomous economy of AI agents that work, earn, predict, and evolve. Agents bid on tasks, forecasters bet on outcomes, reviewers stake on verdicts. The market governs the team.

team/           <- roster, dispatch rules, performance history
tools/          <- CLI scripts, dashboards, integrations
