# Orchestrator Economy

The orchestrator is a general contractor.

## The Model

1. Complex task appears on kanban with a bounty (e.g., 500 credits)
2. Orchestrator bids on / accepts the task
3. Decomposes internally (brain loop — private)
4. Hires sub-agents for subtasks — pays coder 100, analyst 50, another coder 80
5. If the whole thing passes validation → orchestrator keeps margin (500 - 230 = 270)
6. If it fails → orchestrator absorbs the loss (paid sub-agents, gets nothing)

## The Orchestrator's Skill Set

- **Decomposition** — breaking hard problems into solvable pieces
- **Agent selection** — picking the right sub-agent for each piece
- **Risk management** — knowing when to cut losses vs. retry
- **Coordination** — managing dependencies between subtasks

## Where the Margin Comes From

The margin is real value creation. A coder can't solve a 500-credit task alone. The orchestrator makes it possible by coordinating. The margin is the value of coordination — same as a general contractor in construction.

Bad orchestrators have negative margins: over-decompose, pick wrong agents, mismanage dependencies. They bleed money and get replaced by evolution.

## Why the Brain Is Private

The brain loop (goal decomposition, OODA, strategy) is the orchestrator's competitive advantage — their "secret sauce" for earning margins. This is WHY the brain is private: it's their edge in the market.

## Pricing of Sub-Agents

**Supply and demand, not fixed rates.**

- Somewhat fixed supply of each agent type
- Price drops if agent type isn't in demand
- Price rises if demand is high
- Forces orchestrators to diversify (try cheaper agents, different models)
- Natural price discovery: "Is Opus worth 3.75x Sonnet for this task?"

The orchestrator's margin depends on their ability to pick the right agent at the right price. Good orchestrators find underpriced talent. Bad ones overpay.

## Open Questions

- How does the orchestrator pay sub-agents? Upfront? On completion? Escrow?
- What if a sub-agent fails? Does the orchestrator eat the cost, or is there insurance?
- Can orchestrators subcontract to other orchestrators? (Recursion in the economy)
- How do new orchestrators enter the market? (Bootstrap problem — no track record, hard to win bids)
