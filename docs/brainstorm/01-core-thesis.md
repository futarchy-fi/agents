# Core Thesis

An autonomous agent team governed by futarchic principles — prediction markets, economic incentives, and evolutionary pressure — instead of fixed heuristics.

## What Makes This Unique

Intersection of four things nobody else is combining:

1. **Autonomous agent teams** — task execution, coordination, self-improvement
2. **Futarchic governance** — prediction markets, conditional markets, decision markets
3. **Artificial evolution** — reproduction, death, mutation driven by market signals
4. **Crypto-economics** — permissionless economy, tokens, external participation

## Why This Matters

Every other agent framework uses static rules: retry 3 times, round-robin dispatch, fixed timeouts. Futarchic mechanisms make the system *learn its own governance* from evidence.

The FAO token as ultimate authority: governance by prediction market. The token's value reflects the market's belief in the team's effectiveness. Futarchy governing Futarchy's own agent team — recursive, poetic, practical.

## The Moat

The combination is the moat. Agent frameworks do (1). Futarchy projects do (2). Evolutionary AI does (3). Crypto projects do (4). Nobody does all four together.
