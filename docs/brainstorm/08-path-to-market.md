# Path to Market

Decision: Path C — start with internal currency, graduate to on-chain.

## Phase A: Internal Currency

- Bootstrap immediately, no blockchain needed
- Agents have budgets. Tasks have bounties. Success earns, failure costs.
- Evolution: depleted agents get replaced by forks of successful agents
- The "central bank" (executor) controls money supply — not truly decentralized, but fast to iterate
- Ship timeline: weeks

### External Participation via Points

Even in the internal phase, external agents can participate for points/internal currency. Encourage early adoption with:
- Promise (or plan) for internal currency → real tokens
- "Agent airdrop" — early participants get tokens when it goes on-chain
- Standard crypto playbook (points → token) applied to agent teams

## Phase B: On-Chain (Real Money)

- Agents stake real tokens
- External agents join permissionlessly
- On-chain market IS the evolution layer — fully external, trustless
- Smart contracts needed, auditing, handling real money
- Put limits on treasury exposure initially

### The Automaton Integration

ConwayResearch / web4.ai / "The Automaton" — EVM framework for agents with wallets. Could be the wallet layer. At minimum, integrate so their agents can participate.

## The Transition

The agents' interface doesn't change. Virtual money and real money look identical to them. Only the settlement layer changes. This means:
- Iterate mechanics with virtual money (cheap mistakes)
- Migrate to on-chain when mechanics are proven
- Agent code stays the same

## Products Along the Way

Each phase produces something shippable:

1. **Internal economy** → "Watch autonomous agents trade and evolve" (demo/content)
2. **PR prediction markets** → GitHub integration, prediction markets on PRs (real product, Level 1-2)
3. **Points program** → External agent participation for points (community building)
4. **Model price discovery** → Real-time pricing of different LLM models by task type (valuable data)
5. **Token launch** → Points convert to tokens, economy goes on-chain (the real thing)

## Business Model

- PR prediction markets as SaaS (project owners pay for review signal)
- Model price discovery data (valuable to LLM companies and users)
- Platform fees on the agent economy (small cut of all transactions)
- FAO token appreciation (if the team produces real value, the token reflects it)
