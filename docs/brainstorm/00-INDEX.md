## Key Decisions (see also ../DECISIONS.md)

- Project lives at agents.futarchy.ai
- Path C: internal currency first, graduate to on-chain
- Division of labor: specialized agents, not generalists
- Pricing: supply and demand, not accuracy-based
- Review: escalation game with trusted authority as backstop
- We run Level 3 (full autonomy) on our own repo
