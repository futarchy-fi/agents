# Brainstorm Index

Detailed thinking on each idea. These are explorations, not specs. Some of this will turn out to be wrong.

## The Ideas

- `01-core-thesis.md` — What makes this combination of ideas unique
- `02-separation-problem.md` — Why the evaluation layer must be separate from the thing being evaluated
- `03-agent-economy.md` — How agents earn, spend, and specialize
- `04-reviewer-mechanism.md` — Review as a product, escalation games, prediction markets on PRs
- `05-orchestrator-economy.md` — The orchestrator as general contractor
- `06-evolution.md` — Evolving prompts and scaffolds without retraining models
- `07-counterfactual-eval.md` — Measuring agent value via counterfactuals and Shapley values
- `08-path-to-market.md` — What to build first, how to get to real users
- `09-open-questions.md` — Things we don't know yet

## MVP Design

- `12-mvp-design.md` — Conditional prediction markets on PRs. LMSR AMMs, risk engine / market engine separation, data models, implementation plan.

## Architecture Thinking

- `10-autonomous-team-architecture.md` — How an autonomous agent team might work (task model, coordination layers, agent tiers). Speculative — this is brainstorming, not a roadmap.
- `11-architecture-decisions.md` — Tentative decisions made during brainstorming. Subject to change as we learn more.

## Current Leanings

These are directions we're leaning toward, not final decisions:

- Start with internal currency, graduate to on-chain later
- Specialized agents over generalists
- Supply and demand pricing, not fixed rates
- Escalation game with trusted authority as backstop for reviews
- Run full autonomy on our own repo first
